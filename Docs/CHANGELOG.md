## 🚀 Release v1.0.0 — Full API Completion & Unified Standard

**Release Date:** 2026-02-20

This major milestone marks the **100% completion** of the qBittorrent Web API implementation. Version 1.0.0 introduces the remaining service modules, full documentation coverage, and a significant refactoring of naming conventions to ensure long-term consistency and predictability across the library.

---

### ✨ Added

* **Full API Coverage:** – Implemented all remaining core services:
    * `ApplicationService` – System state and server controls.
    * `LogService` – Server log and main log access.
    * `TransferService` – Global transfer info and speed limits.
    * `SyncService` – Main and torrent-specific synchronization.
    * `RssService` – RSS feeds, articles, and automated rules.
    * `SearchService` – Search jobs, plugin management, and results.


* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Added XML documentation comments to all public classes, properties, and methods for enhanced IntelliSense support.

---

### 🔧 Changed (Breaking Changes)

* **Unified Boolean Naming:** To eliminate ambiguity, most boolean properties have been renamed from `IsXXX` or `EnableXXX` to the `XXXEnabled` pattern.
* **Standardized Property Suffixes:** Replaced inconsistent suffixes like `Total`, `Num`, or `List` with `Count` and other descriptive terms.

**Key Renaming Mapping:**

| Old Name | New Name (v1.0.0) |
| --- | --- |
| `DiskCacheTtlSeconds` | `DiskCacheTtl` |
| `dht` | `DistributedHashTableEnabled` |
| `pex` | `PeerExchangeEnabled` |
| `lsd` | `LocalServiceDiscoveryEnabled` |
| `EnableCoalesceReadWrite` | `CoalesceReadWriteEnabled` |
| `EnableEmbeddedTracker` | `EmbeddedTrackerEnabled` |
| `IsSeed` / `IsPrivate` | `SeedEnabled` / `PrivateEnabled` |
| `AutoTmm` / `ForceStart` | `AutoTmmEnabled` / `ForceStartEnabled` |
| `SeqDl` / `SuperSeeding` | `SequentialDownloadEnabled` / `SuperSeedingEnabled` |
| `IsQueueingEnabled` | `QueueingEnabled` |
| `UseAltSpeedLimits` | `AltSpeedLimitsEnabled` |
| `PeersTotal` / `NumPeers` | `PeersCount` |
| `SeedsTotal` / `NumSeeds` | `SeedsCount` |
| `NumLeeches` / `NumDownloaded` | `LeechesCount` / `DownloadedCount` |
| `DhtNodes` | `DhtNodesCount` |

---

### 🧱 Completed Module

* ✅ **100% API Implementation:** Every endpoint group defined in the official qBittorrent Web API is now fully supported.

---

### 🧹 Improved

* **Naming Consistency:** Performed a global sweep to align method signatures and property names with the new unified standard.

---

### 📦 Notes

This is a **major release** and contains **breaking changes** regarding property names. If you are upgrading from any v0.x.x version, please refer to the renaming table above to update your implementation.

## 🚀 Release v0.1.1 — Authentication Service & Network Refactoring

**Release Date:** 2025-12-06

This release focuses on **internal architectural improvements**, decoupling authentication logic from core network utilities.  
It introduces a dedicated **Authentication Service** and moves network handling to a new namespace to better align with the qBittorrent API structure.

---

### ✨ Added

- Added **AuthenticationService**
  - Implements explicit `Login` and `Logout` functionality.
  - Authentication logic is now separated from generic network requests, adhering to the API endpoint categorization.

---

### 🔧 Changed

- **Refactored Network Utilities:**
  - Moved `NetUtils` from `Banned.Qbittorrent.Utils.NetUtils` to `Banned.Qbittorrent.Services.NetServices`.
- **Decoupled Authentication Logic:**
  - Login operations are no longer implicitly handled within internal `Get` and `Post` network calls.
  - Authentication is now managed independently via the new `AuthenticationService`.

---

### 📦 Notes

This is primarily a structural refactor to improve code organization and maintainability.  
If your code directly references the internal `NetUtils` class, please update your namespace references to `Banned.Qbittorrent.Services`.
